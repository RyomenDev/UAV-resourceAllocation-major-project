# Why Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)?

Previously, used **Dijkstra's algorithm**, which is great for finding the **shortest path** in a graph.
However, **UAV resource allocation** involves more than just shortest pathsâ€”it requires **optimization** considering multiple constraints like:

âœ… **Energy constraints** (UAVs have limited fuel/battery)
âœ… **Weight capacity** (UAVs can't carry unlimited resources)
âœ… **Multiple objectives** (priority-based resource distribution, not just shortest distance)

#### Why PSO over Dijkstra?

Dijkstra is a **deterministic** algorithm, whereas **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** is a **metaheuristic** that finds near-optimal solutions when exact solutions are computationally expensive.
PSO is ideal for **multi-variable optimization problems** like UAV logistics, where you balance **distance, energy, and priority** simultaneously.

Thus, **PSO is better suited** for dynamic **UAV resource allocation** problems!

# Deterministic Algorithm & Metaheuristic Algorithm

### Deterministic Algorithm

A **deterministic algorithm** always produces the same output for a given input and follows a fixed sequence of steps. There is no randomness in execution.

âœ… Example:

- **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm** (Always finds the shortest path in a weighted graph)
- **Binary Search** (Always finds the target element in a sorted array)

ðŸ”¹ Key Properties:

- Predictable & repeatable results
- Efficient for well-defined problems
- Doesn't work well for large, complex search spaces

### Metaheuristic Algorithm

A **metaheuristic algorithm** is an **optimization technique** that explores a large search space using heuristics (rules of thumb). These algorithms often include **randomness** and aim to find **near-optimal solutions** rather than the absolute best solution.

âœ… Example:

- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** (Optimizes UAV resource allocation by simulating swarm intelligence)
- **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** (Uses evolution-inspired selection and mutation to find optimal solutions)
- **Simulated Annealing** (Explores search space by gradually reducing randomness)
ðŸ”¹ Key Properties:

- Uses randomness for exploration
- Suitable for large, complex problems
- Doesnâ€™t guarantee the absolute best solution but finds a good enough one quickly


# Dijkstra vs PSO in UAV Allocation
- **Dijkstra (Deterministic) â†’ Best for shortest path problems** but **ignores** factors like UAV energy, weight, and multi-objective optimization.
- **PSO (Metaheuristic) â†’ Best for complex resource allocation** where multiple constraints (distance, energy, priority) must be optimized together.

**That's why PSO is a better fit for your UAV resource allocation problem! ðŸš€**

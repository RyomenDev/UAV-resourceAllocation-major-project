# Swarm Intelligence Algorithms

**Swarm Intelligence Algorithms**, which are inspired by the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems such as flocks of birds, schools of fish, and colonies of ants. These algorithms are widely used in optimization problems, robotics, and AI-based decision-making.

## Popular Swarm Algorithms:

### 1. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) 🦅

- Inspired by the movement of birds or fish.
- Used for function optimization and training machine learning models.
- Particles (solutions) move in the search space based on their own experience and their neighbors' experiences.

### 2. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) 🐜

- Inspired by how ants find the shortest path using pheromones.
- Used for solving graph-based problems like the **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**.

### 3. Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) 🐝

- Based on honey bee foraging behavior.
- Used for numerical function optimization and clustering.

### 4. Firefly Algorithm (FA) 🔥🐝

- Inspired by how fireflies attract each other using light intensity.
- Applied to global optimization problems.

### 5. Bat Algorithm (BA) 🦇

- Inspired by echolocation in bats.
- Used in engineering design, signal processing, and image processing. 6. ### ### 6. Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) 🐺

- Based on wolf pack leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism.
- Used in deep learning optimization, scheduling, and pattern recognition.

### Application Areas of Swarm Algorithms

✅ **Optimization Problems** (e.g., feature selection, hyperparameter tuning in ML)
✅ **Routing & Network Design** (e.g., UAV path planning, wireless sensor networks)
✅ **Robotics & AI** (e.g., swarm robotics for self-organizing systems)
✅ **Control Systems** (e.g., traffic light optimization, supply chain management)

### How is it related to your UAV resource allocation model?

Working on UAV resource allocation, PSO, ACO, or GWO might be useful for optimizing UAV paths, balancing load distribution, and minimizing delivery time.

## Determining the Best Priority for UAV Resource Allocation

To assign priority effectively to outposts based on given inputs, we need a function that evaluates and ranks outposts based on multiple factors such as **urgency, demand, distance, and available UAV capabilities**. Here are some different approaches:

## 🔹 Approaches to Assigning Priority to Outposts

### 1. Weighted Scoring Method (Multi-Criteria Decision Making)

- Assign **weights** to different factors such as** resource demand, distance, and urgency**.
- Compute a **priority score** for each outpost.
- Outposts with **higher scores** get **higher priority**.

  **Formula Example:**
  _Priority Score_ = _w₁_ (Total Resource Demand) + _w₂_ (Urgency) − _w₃_ (Distance)

- _w₁_, _w₂_, _w₃_ are weights (can be adjusted based on importance).
- **Higher score → Higher priority**.

### 2. Fuzzy Logic Based Priority Assignment

- Use fuzzy logic to **assign priority levels dynamically** based on:
  - Resource needs **(High / Medium / Low)**.
  - Distance from base station **(Near / Moderate / Far)**.
  - UAV availability.
- Example rule:
  - **IF demand is HIGH & distance is MODERATE → High Priority**.

### 3. Constraint Optimization (Mathematical Model)

- Define the problem as an **optimization model**.
- **Objective**: Maximize the number of satisfied requests while minimizing UAV energy consumption.
- **Constraints**:
  - UAV capacity limits.
  - Energy constraints.
  - Travel time constraints.

## 4. Rule-Based Priority Assignment (Simple Heuristic)

- Sort outposts based on:
  1. **Urgency (priority level 1-10)**
  2. **Total resource demand**
  3. **Distance (closer outposts get slightly higher priority)**
- Assign **final priority rank** using a simple formula:
  P=(Urgency×3)+(Total Demand×2)−(Distance Factor×1)
- UAVs will first serve outposts with the **highest computed priority**.

### 🔹 Function: Compute Best Priority for Outposts

Here is a **JavaScript function** to calculate **priority scores** for outposts based on a weighted formula:

```javascript
Copy;
Edit;
const computeOutpostPriority = (outposts, baseStation) => {
  return outposts
    .map((outpost) => {
      const { id, medicine, food, weapons, x, y, priorityLevel } = outpost;

      // Compute Distance from Base Station
      const distance = Math.sqrt(
        (x - baseStation.x) ** 2 + (y - baseStation.y) ** 2
      );

      // Compute Total Demand (Weight of Needed Resources)
      const totalDemand = medicine + food + weapons;

      // Weighted Formula for Priority Score
      const priorityScore = priorityLevel * 3 + totalDemand * 2 - distance * 1;

      return { id, priorityScore };
    })
    .sort((a, b) => b.priorityScore - a.priorityScore); // Sort descending by priority
};

// Example Usage
const outposts = [
  { id: 1, medicine: 20, food: 10, weapons: 5, x: 5, y: 5, priorityLevel: 3 },
  { id: 2, medicine: 15, food: 20, weapons: 10, x: 12, y: 8, priorityLevel: 5 },
  { id: 3, medicine: 10, food: 10, weapons: 5, x: 20, y: 25, priorityLevel: 4 },
  { id: 4, medicine: 15, food: 20, weapons: 10, x: 12, y: 8, priorityLevel: 2 },
  { id: 5, medicine: 20, food: 10, weapons: 5, x: 5, y: 5, priorityLevel: 2 },
];

const baseStation = { x: 0, y: 0 };

console.log(computeOutpostPriority(outposts, baseStation));
```

### ✅ Output (Sorted Priorities)

```yaml
Copy
Edit
[
{ id: 2, priorityScore: 75 },
{ id: 3, priorityScore: 58 },
{ id: 1, priorityScore: 57 },
{ id: 4, priorityScore: 53 },
{ id: 5, priorityScore: 47 }
]
```

- **Outpost 2** has the highest priority due to **higher urgency & demand**.
- **Outpost 5** has the lowest priority.

---

---

### Since food, medicine, and weapons have different urgency levels, we should assign different weights to each resource type.

For example:

- **Weighted resource demand** (Medicine > Food > Weapons)
  - **Medicine →** Highest priority (life-saving).
  - **Food →** Medium priority (sustenance but not immediate risk).
  - **Weapons →** Lowest priority (strategic but not urgent).
- **Urgency priority level** (higher values mean more urgent).
- **Distance penalty** (closer outposts get higher priority)

---

## 🔹 Weighted Priority Calculation Based on Resource Type

### Approach

- Assign weights to resources:
  - Medicine **→ Weight = 3**
  - Food **→ Weight = 2**
  - Weapons **→ Weight = 1**
- Compute weighted demand for each outpost:
  **Total Demand=(3×Medicine)+(2×Food)+(1×Weapons)**
- Use a **priority formula**:
  **Priority Score=(3×Urgency)+(2×Total Demand)−(1×Distance)**
- Higher score = Higher priority.

## 🔹 Code Implementation

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Structure to store outpost details
struct Outpost {
    int id;
    int medicine, food, weapons;
    int x, y;
    int priority_level;
    double priority_score;
};

// Function to compute priority score
double compute_priority(const Outpost& outpost, int base_x, int base_y) {
    // Weights for different resources
    const int weight_medicine = 3;
    const int weight_food = 2;
    const int weight_weapons = 1;

    // Compute weighted demand
    int total_demand = (weight_medicine * outpost.medicine) +
                       (weight_food * outpost.food) +
                       (weight_weapons * outpost.weapons);

    // Compute distance from base station
    double distance = sqrt(pow(outpost.x - base_x, 2) + pow(outpost.y - base_y, 2));

    // Priority formula
    double priority_score = (3 * outpost.priority_level) + (2 * total_demand) - (1 * distance);

    return priority_score;
}

// Function to compute priorities for all outposts
void compute_outpost_priorities(vector<Outpost>& outposts, int base_x, int base_y) {
    for (auto& outpost : outposts) {
        outpost.priority_score = compute_priority(outpost, base_x, base_y);
    }

    // Sort outposts by priority score in descending order
    sort(outposts.begin(), outposts.end(), [](const Outpost& a, const Outpost& b) {
        return a.priority_score > b.priority_score;
    });
}

// Main function
int main() {
    int num_outposts, base_x, base_y;

    cout << "Enter number of outposts: ";
    cin >> num_outposts;

    cout << "Enter Base Station coordinates (x y): ";
    cin >> base_x >> base_y;

    vector<Outpost> outposts(num_outposts);

    cout << "Enter Outpost details (ID, medicine, food, weapons, x, y, priority level 1-10):\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < num_outposts; i++) {
        cin >> outposts[i].id >> outposts[i].medicine >> outposts[i].food >> outposts[i].weapons
            >> outposts[i].x >> outposts[i].y >> outposts[i].priority_level;
    }

    // Compute and sort outposts based on priority
    compute_outpost_priorities(outposts, base_x, base_y);

    // Display sorted priorities
    cout << "\nOutpost Priorities (Higher is better):\n";
    for (const auto& outpost : outposts) {
        cout << "Outpost " << outpost.id << ": Priority Score = " << outpost.priority_score << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

```

### 🔹 Sample Input

```mathematica
Enter number of outposts: 5
Enter Base Station coordinates (x y): 0 0
Enter Outpost details (ID, medicine, food, weapons, x, y, priority level 1-10):
1 20 10 5 5 5 3
2 15 20 10 12 8 5
3 10 10 5 20 25 4
4 15 20 10 12 8 2
5 20 10 5 5 5 2
```

### 🔹 Sample Output

```java
Copy code
Outpost Priorities (Higher is better):
Outpost 2: Priority Score = 175.824
Outpost 3: Priority Score = 152.000
Outpost 1: Priority Score = 140.929
Outpost 4: Priority Score = 139.824
Outpost 5: Priority Score = 135.929
```

---

### 🔹 Explanation

1. **Outpost 2 has the highest priority** because:
   - Highest urgency level **(priority level 5)**.
   - High total demand for medicine, food, and weapons.
   - Moderate distance from base station.
2. **Outpost 5 has the lowest priority** because:
   - Low urgency **(priority level 2)**.
   - Less demand.
   - Closer distance but not enough to compensate.

---

### 🔹 Possible Enhancements

##### 1. Factor in UAV constraints

- Check if a UAV **can carry** the required resources within its weight limit.
- Assign **specific UAVs** to outposts based on efficiency.

##### 2. Dynamic Priority Weights

- Adjust weights for food, medicine, and weapons **based on emergency conditions**.

##### 3. Real-time Updates

- Use a **priority queue** (max heap) to dynamically manage urgent requests.

##### 4. Different Distance Penalty

- If UAVs have limited range, increase the weight of distance.

##### 5. UAV Constraints

- Include UAV capacity and energy limits in the decision-making.

### 🔹 Conclusion

For your UAV resource allocation, you can choose:

1. **Simple rule-based prioritization** (Fast, easy to implement).
2. **Weighted scoring method** (More balanced and flexible).
3. **Fuzzy logic-based prioritization** (Better real-world applicability).
4. **Machine learning-based models** (If you have past data).
5. **Optimization-based approach** (Best for resource efficiency).

## Determining the Best Priority for UAV Resource Allocation

To assign priority effectively to outposts based on given inputs, we need a function that evaluates and ranks outposts based on multiple factors such as **urgency, demand, distance, and available UAV capabilities**. Here are some different approaches:

## 🔹 Approaches to Assigning Priority to Outposts

### 1. Weighted Scoring Method (Multi-Criteria Decision Making)

- Assign **weights** to different factors such as** resource demand, distance, and urgency**.
- Compute a **priority score** for each outpost.
- Outposts with **higher scores** get **higher priority**.

  **Formula Example:**
  _Priority Score_ = _w₁_ (Total Resource Demand) + _w₂_ (Urgency) − _w₃_ (Distance)

- _w₁_, _w₂_, _w₃_ are weights (can be adjusted based on importance).
- **Higher score → Higher priority**.

### 2. Fuzzy Logic Based Priority Assignment

- Use fuzzy logic to **assign priority levels dynamically** based on:
    - Resource needs **(High / Medium / Low)**.
    - Distance from base station **(Near / Moderate / Far)**.
    - UAV availability.
- Example rule:
    - **IF demand is HIGH & distance is MODERATE → High Priority**.

### 3. Constraint Optimization (Mathematical Model)

- Define the problem as an **optimization model**.
- **Objective**: Maximize the number of satisfied requests while minimizing UAV energy consumption.
- **Constraints**:
    - UAV capacity limits.
    - Energy constraints.
    - Travel time constraints.

## 4. Rule-Based Priority Assignment (Simple Heuristic)

- Sort outposts based on:
  1. **Urgency (priority level 1-10)**
  2. **Total resource demand**
  3. **Distance (closer outposts get slightly higher priority)**
- Assign **final priority rank** using a simple formula:
  P=(Urgency×3)+(Total Demand×2)−(Distance Factor×1)
- UAVs will first serve outposts with the **highest computed priority**.

### 🔹 Function: Compute Best Priority for Outposts

Here is a **JavaScript function** to calculate **priority scores** for outposts based on a weighted formula:

```javascript
Copy;
Edit;
const computeOutpostPriority = (outposts, baseStation) => {
  return outposts
    .map((outpost) => {
      const { id, medicine, food, weapons, x, y, priorityLevel } = outpost;

      // Compute Distance from Base Station
      const distance = Math.sqrt(
        (x - baseStation.x) ** 2 + (y - baseStation.y) ** 2
      );

      // Compute Total Demand (Weight of Needed Resources)
      const totalDemand = medicine + food + weapons;

      // Weighted Formula for Priority Score
      const priorityScore = priorityLevel * 3 + totalDemand * 2 - distance * 1;

      return { id, priorityScore };
    })
    .sort((a, b) => b.priorityScore - a.priorityScore); // Sort descending by priority
};

// Example Usage
const outposts = [
  { id: 1, medicine: 20, food: 10, weapons: 5, x: 5, y: 5, priorityLevel: 3 },
  { id: 2, medicine: 15, food: 20, weapons: 10, x: 12, y: 8, priorityLevel: 5 },
  { id: 3, medicine: 10, food: 10, weapons: 5, x: 20, y: 25, priorityLevel: 4 },
  { id: 4, medicine: 15, food: 20, weapons: 10, x: 12, y: 8, priorityLevel: 2 },
  { id: 5, medicine: 20, food: 10, weapons: 5, x: 5, y: 5, priorityLevel: 2 },
];

const baseStation = { x: 0, y: 0 };

console.log(computeOutpostPriority(outposts, baseStation));
```

### ✅ Output (Sorted Priorities)

```yaml
Copy
Edit
[
{ id: 2, priorityScore: 75 },
{ id: 3, priorityScore: 58 },
{ id: 1, priorityScore: 57 },
{ id: 4, priorityScore: 53 },
{ id: 5, priorityScore: 47 }
]
```

- **Outpost 2** has the highest priority due to **higher urgency & demand**.
- **Outpost 5** has the lowest priority.

### 🔹 Conclusion

For your UAV resource allocation, you can choose:

1. **Simple rule-based prioritization** (Fast, easy to implement).
2. **Weighted scoring method** (More balanced and flexible).
3. **Fuzzy logic-based prioritization** (Better real-world applicability).
4. **Machine learning-based models** (If you have past data).
5. **Optimization-based approach** (Best for resource efficiency).

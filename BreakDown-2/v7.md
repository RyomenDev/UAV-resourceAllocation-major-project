To incorporate UAV recharging and prioritize timing in your UAV allocation model, I will update the logic as follows:

**1. Sequential Deployment Based on Travel Time:**

- Assign UAVs to different outposts considering the time required for the first UAV to return.
- If a UAV is engaged in a mission, assign the next available UAV to the next outpost.

**2. Immediate Recharge Upon Return:**

- Once a UAV returns, assume it is instantly recharged and can be reassigned.

**3. All Outposts Must Be Reached (or Report Unreachable):**

- If an outpost cannot be reached due to UAV constraints, print the reason.

## Changes to the Code

- Introduce a **time-based assignment strategy** that considers UAV availability.
- Modify the **fitness function** to factor in UAV travel time and sequential dispatch.
- Ensure all outposts are either served or explicitly reported as **unreachable**.

## Key Updates:

**1. Time-based UAV assignment:**

- A priority queue tracks UAV availability.
- UAVs are assigned based on the earliest available time.

**2. UAV Return and Immediate Reuse:**

- Once a UAV completes a mission, it is immediately marked available.

**3. Priority Consideration:**

- Outposts are prioritized based on urgency, distance, and resource need.
- If no UAV can reach an outpost, a warning is displayed.

This ensures **efficient resource allocation** while **minimizing wait time**.

âœ… Time tracking for each UAV's journey (start time, reached time, and return time).
âœ… Distance covered by each UAV for better clarity.
âœ… Failure reasons when UAVs cannot reach an outpost (e.g., "Max reachable distance is X km").

This updated version tracks:
âœ… Time taken for each UAV (Start, Arrival, Return).
âœ… Distance covered for better understanding.
âœ… Failure reasons when UAVs can't reach an outpost.

Let me know if you need more refinements! ðŸš€


Key Improvements
âœ… Time-based UAV assignment: Assign UAVs based on availability, tracking their return times.
âœ… Immediate Recharge: UAVs are instantly recharged after returning.
âœ… Ensured Outpost Coverage: All outposts are either reached or explicitly reported as unreachable.
âœ… Priority-based Scheduling: Outposts are prioritized based on urgency, distance, and resource needs.
âœ… Failure Reasons Displayed: If a UAV can't reach an outpost, the reason is printed.

Key Enhancements
âœ… UAVs assigned based on availability
âœ… Immediate recharge and reuse
âœ… Ensures all outposts are reached or reported as unreachable
âœ… Warnings for unreachable outposts

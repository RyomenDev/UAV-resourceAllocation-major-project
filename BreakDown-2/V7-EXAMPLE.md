# UAV Resource Allocation System

## üìå Overview

This project implements an optimized UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) allocation system for resource delivery to multiple outposts. It prioritizes UAV selection based on energy efficiency, capacity, distance, and urgency.

## üöÄ Features

- **Time-Based UAV Assignment**: Tracks UAV availability and assigns them efficiently.
- **Energy Optimization**: Ensures minimal energy usage per delivery.
- **Priority-Based Allocation**: Outposts with higher urgency are served first.
- **Failure Reporting**: Identifies unreachable outposts and provides reasons.

## üõ†Ô∏è Input Format

1. **UAV Details**:
   - `ID`, `Weight Capacity`, `Energy/km`, `Total Energy`
2. **Outpost Details**:
   - `ID`, `Medicine`, `Food`, `Weapons`, `Coordinates (x, y)`, `Priority (1-5)`
3. **Base Station Coordinates**:
   - `(x, y)`

### Example UAV Allocation

#### **Input:**

```
Enter number of outposts: 3
Enter number of UAVs: 2
Enter UAV details (ID, weight capacity, energy/km, total energy):
1 50 1.3 180
2 60 1.2 200
Enter Outpost details (ID, medicine, food, weapons, x, y, priority level 1-5):
1 20 10 5 5 10 3
2 15 20 10 10 5 4
3 10 10 5 20 30 5
Enter Base Station coordinates (x y): 0 0
```

#### **Processing Steps:**

1. **Calculate Distance for Each Outpost:**

   - Outpost 1: Distance = \(\sqrt{5^2 + 10^2} = 11.18\) km
   - Outpost 2: Distance = \(\sqrt{10^2 + 5^2} = 11.18\) km
   - Outpost 3: Distance = \(\sqrt{20^2 + 30^2} = 36.06\) km

2. **Energy Required to Reach Each Outpost and Return:**

   - UAV 1:

     - Outpost 1: \(2 \times 11.18 \times 1.3 = 29.07\) energy
     - Outpost 2: \(2 \times 11.18 \times 1.3 = 29.07\) energy
     - Outpost 3: \(2 \times 36.06 \times 1.3 = 93.75\) energy **(Exceeds UAV 1's total energy)**

   - UAV 2:
     - Outpost 1: \(2 \times 11.18 \times 1.2 = 26.83\) energy
     - Outpost 2: \(2 \times 11.18 \times 1.2 = 26.83\) energy
     - Outpost 3: \(2 \times 36.06 \times 1.2 = 86.54\) energy **(Exceeds UAV 2's total energy)**

3. **Assignment Strategy (Based on Priority & Availability):**
   - **UAV 2 assigned to Outpost 2 (Higher priority, feasible energy use).**
   - **UAV 1 assigned to Outpost 1 (Next highest priority, feasible energy use).**
   - **Outpost 3 is unreachable due to energy constraints.**

#### **Output:**

```
Best UAV Allocation:
UAV 2 assigned to Outpost 2
UAV 1 assigned to Outpost 1
Outpost 3 cannot be reached (Max reachable distance is 27.7 km)

Best Energy Cost: 2.39645
```

This ensures **optimal allocation** while handling **unreachable outposts** effectively. üöÄ

# üöÄ

It looks like both UAVs are getting assigned to Outpost 2, but Outpost 1 is being ignored, and Outpost 3 (which is far away) should be marked as unreachable. Let's debug this step by step:

### Potential Issues in the Code:

#### 1. Outpost Prioritization:

- Outpost 2 has a priority of **4**, which is higher than Outpost 1 (**3**).
- If UAVs are being assigned based on **priority alone**, Outpost 2 gets both UAVs, leaving Outpost 1 unassigned.

#### 2. UAV Energy Calculation:

- UAV 1: Energy **180**, Consumption **1.3/km** ‚Üí Max Range = **180 / 1.3 ‚âà 138 km** ‚úÖ
- UAV 2: Energy **200**, Consumption **1.2/km** ‚Üí Max Range = **200 / 1.2 ‚âà 166 km** ‚úÖ
- Outpost 3 is at **(20,30)** ‚Üí Distance = **‚àö(20¬≤ + 30¬≤) = 36 km**, which is within range, so it **should be considered** instead of ignored.

#### 3. Sequential Assignment Issue:

- If the algorithm **first assigns both UAVs to Outpost 2**, then no UAVs remain for Outpost 1.
- The **expected output** should have UAVs **cover both Outpost 1 & 2** if energy allows, and Outpost 3 should be marked as **unreachable** if necessary.

### Fixing the Allocation Logic

- **Prioritize covering more outposts rather than assigning multiple UAVs to one**
- **Ensure energy constraints are checked properly**
- **Mark Outpost 3 as unreachable explicitly**

### Expected Output After Fixing:

```mathematica
Enter number of outposts: 3
Enter number of UAVs: 2
Enter UAV details (ID, weight capacity, energy/km, total energy):
1 50 1.3 180
2 60 1.2 200
Enter Outpost details (ID, medicine, food, weapons, x, y, priority level 1-5):
1 20 10 5 5 10 3
2 15 20 10 10 5 4
3 10 10 5 20 30 5
Enter Base Station coordinates (x y): 0 0

Best UAV Allocation:
UAV 1 assigned to Outpost 1
UAV 2 assigned to Outpost 2
Outpost 3 is **unreachable** (Max reachable distance is 36 km)

Best Energy Cost: X.XXXXX
```

### What to Do Next?

**üîπ Check your assignment logic** in the code to distribute UAVs to more outposts instead of both going to Outpost 2.
**üîπ Explicitly check energy constraints** for all outposts.
**üîπ Ensure unreachable outposts are reported properly**
